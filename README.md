# ChatBot

*A lab report by Benjamin Yellin*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

I made a ChatBot that plays the Who Stole the Cookie from the Cookie Jar game, where the computer gives on line and then the user inputs the next line. 

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
